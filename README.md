Welcome to the new HCSA website,

We made the Honors College Student Associate Webpage that it will be launching this upcoming fall. 

Currently, we have the home page, event page, and member page. 

In the home page, you can find the HCSA introduction, goals/missions, and the upcoming events.
While the images were hard coded, the remaining was using handlebars. 
Inside the home page, you can see that there is a part of upcoming events. That part was also using the event handlebar to display in that.
While there are total 4 different event we made, there will only one that will be displaying which the most current one. 

In the event page, you can see that there is a search bar to look up the event that the user wants to find. 
At the same time, there is RSVP button to RSVP the event. Once you click that button, you will get a pop-up/modal 
that will make the user to enter the name, student email address, and student ONID. 
Once the user select the and press confirm, then it will update the box that who is coming for email address and name, but not the ONID. 
Below the Event boxes, there is a calendar so it is easy to see what events will be coming for the month. 

In the members page, you can see the profile of club(currently, those who worked on the site) such as their picture, bio, and links to contact them. 

Last, there is a 404 error page if you use different path rather than the designated path for each page.

I hope this readme is helpful for understanding what we accomplished...


Best,

Group 42
